COMP 141: Course Project
Phase 3.1: Evaluator for Lexp

This program integrates a scanner (Phase 1.2) and a parser for Lexp.
It reads an input file (with a single expression), tokenizes it, and then parses
the tokens to build an abstract syntax tree (AST). The tokens and AST are printed
to the output file.
